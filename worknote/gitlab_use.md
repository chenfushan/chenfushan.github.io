## Add to one group

If you want to access some private repos. You need to join the group first.

After that, let the administrator give the repository access to your account. And then you can see the repository.

## clone to locale

Use ` git clone https://xxxx ` to clone the repository to locale. In china it may be a bit slow. Just wait for a moment.
